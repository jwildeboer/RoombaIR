# RoombaIR

Simple solution to send IR remote commands to a Roomba using a Nanode V5 via a simple web page

- Uses **send_roomba** function from [Super Simple Arduino Powered Roomba Scheduler](http://www.instructables.com/id/Super-Simple-Arduino-Powered-Roomba-Scheduler/step3/Arduino-Script/)
- HTTP "server" Based on BackSoon example of the [Ethercard](https://github.com/jcw/ethercard) library
